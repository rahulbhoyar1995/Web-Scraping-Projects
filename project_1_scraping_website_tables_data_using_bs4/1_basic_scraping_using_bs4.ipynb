initially in varying forms of isolation as huntergatherers has made the region highly diverse second only to Africa in human genetic diversity31 Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9000 years ago evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE32 By 1200 BCE an archaic form of Sanskrit an IndoEuropean language had diffused into India from the northwest3334 Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the Rigveda Preserved by an oral tradition that was resolutely vigilant the Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India35 The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions36 By 400 BCE stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism37 and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity38 Early political consolidations gave rise to the looseknit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin39 Their collective era was suffused with wideranging creativity40 but also marked by the declining status of women41 and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of beliefk42 In South India the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidianlanguages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia43', 'In the early medieval era Christianity Islam Judaism and Zoroastrianism became established on Indias southern and western coasts44 Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran Indias northern plains45 eventually founding the Delhi Sultanate and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam46 In the 15th century the Vijayanagara Empire created a longlasting composite Hindu culture in south India47 In the Punjab Sikhism emerged rejecting

Company followed turning India into a colonial economy but also consolidating its sovereignty51 British Crown rule began in 1858 The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly5253 but technological changes were introduced and modern ideas of education and the public life took root54 A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule5556 In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions57585960 a Hindumajority Dominion of India and a Muslimmajority Dominion of Pakistan amid largescale loss of life and an unprecedented migration61', 'India has been a federal republic since 1950 governed through a democratic parliamentary system It is a pluralistic multilingual and multiethnic society Indias population grew from 361 million in 1951 to almost 14 billion in 202262 During the same time its nominal per capita income increased from US64 annually to US2601 and its literacy rate from 166 to 74 From being a comparatively destitute country in 195163 India has become a fastgrowing major economy and a hub for information technology services with an expanding middle class64 India has a space programme with several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions Indian movies music and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture65 India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty though at the cost of increasing economic inequality66 India is a nuclearweapon state which ranks high in military expenditure It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours Pakistan and China unresolved since the mid20th century67 Among the socioeconomic challenges India faces are gender inequality child malnutrition68 and rising levels of air pollution69 Indias land is megadiverse with four biodiversity hotspots70 Its forest cover comprises 217 of its area71 Indias wildlife which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in Indias culture72 is supported among these forests and elsewhere in protected habitats', 'According to the Oxford English Dictionary third edition 2009 the name India is derived from the Classical Latin India a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east In turn the name India derived successively from Hellenistic Greek India ancient Greek Indos Old Persian Hindush an eastern province of the Achaemenid Empire and ultimately its cognate the Sanskrit Sindhu or river specifically the Indus River and by implication its wellsettled southern basin7374 The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi which translates as The people of the Indus75', 'The term Bharat Bhrat pronounced bat mentioned in both Indian epic poetry and the Constitution of India7677 is used in its variations by many Indian languages A modern rendering of the historical name Bharatavarsha which applied originally to North India7879 Bharat gained increased currency from the mid19th century as a native name for India7680', 'Hindustan ndstan is a Middle Persian name for India that became popular by the 13th century81 and was used widely since the era of the Mughal Empire The meaning of Hindustan has varied referring to a region encompassing presentday northern India and Pakistan or to India in its near entirety768082', 'By 55000 years ago the first modern humans or Homo sapiens had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa where they had earlier evolved282930 The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30000 years ago28 After 6500 BCE evidence for domestication of food crops and animals construction of permanent structures and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in Balochistan Pakistan84 These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation8584 the first urban culture in South Asia86 which flourished during 25001900 BCE in Pakistan and western India87 Centred around cities such as Mohenjodaro Harappa Dholavira and Kalibangan and relying on varied forms of subsistence the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wideranging trade86', 'During the period 2000500 BCE many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones88 The Vedas the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism89 were composed during this period90 and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain88 Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of IndoAryan migration into the subcontinent from the northwest89 The caste system which created a hierarchy of priests warriors and free peasants but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure arose during this period91 On the Deccan Plateau archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation88 In South India a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period92 as well as by nearby traces of agriculture irrigation tanks and craft traditions92', 'In the late Vedic period around the 6th century BCE the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the northwestern regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas9394 The emerging urbanisation gave rise to nonVedic religious movements two of which became independent religions Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar Mahavira95 Buddhism based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India969798 In an age of increasing urban wealth both religions held up renunciation as an ideal99 and both established longlasting monastic traditions Politically by the 3rd century BCE the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire100 The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas101102 The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empirebuilding and determined management of public life as for Ashokas renunciation of militarism and farflung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma103104', 'The Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that between 200 BCE and 200 CE the southern peninsula was ruled by the Cheras the Cholas and the Pandyas dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and Southeast Asia105106 In North India Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family leading to increased subordination of women107100 By the 4th and 5th centuries the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms108109 Under the Guptas a renewed Hinduism based on devotion rather than the management of ritual began to assert itself110 This renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture which found patrons among an urban elite109 Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well and Indian science astronomy medicine and mathematics made significant advances109', 'The Indian early medieval age from 600 to 1200 CE is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity111 When Harsha of Kannauj who ruled much of the IndoGangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE attempted to expand southwards he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan112 When his successor attempted to expand eastwards he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal112 When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south112 No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region111 During this time pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society as were new nontraditional ruling classes113 The caste system consequently began to show regional differences113', 'In the 6th and 7th centuries the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language114 They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent114 Indian royalty big and small and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities which became economic hubs as well115 Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation115 By the 8th and 9th centuries the effects were felt in Southeast Asia as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modernday Myanmar Thailand Laos Brunei Cambodia Vietnam Philippines Malaysia and Indonesia116 Indian merchants scholars and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission Southeast Asians took the initiative as well with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages116', 'After the 10th century Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans using swifthorse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion repeatedly overran South Asias northwestern plains leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206117 The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites the sultanate largely left its vast nonMuslim subject population to its own laws and customs118119 By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers learned men mystics traders artists and artisans from that region into the subcontinent thereby creating a syncretic IndoIslamic culture in the north120121 The sultanates raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire122 Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate the empire came to control much of peninsular India123 and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards122', 'In the early 16th century northern India then under mainly Muslim rulers124 fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors125 The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule Instead it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices126127 and diverse and inclusive ruling elites128 leading to more systematic centralised and uniform rule129 Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity especially under Akbar the Mughals united their farflung realms through loyalty expressed through a Persianised culture to an emperor who had neardivine status128 The Mughal states economic policies deriving most revenues from agriculture130 and mandating that taxes be paid in the wellregulated silver currency131 caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets129 The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in Indias economic expansion129 resulting in greater patronage of painting literary forms textiles and architecture132 Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India such as the Marathas the Rajputs and the Sikhs gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule which through collaboration or adversity gave them both recognition and military experience133 Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India133 As the empire disintegrated many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs134', 'By the early 18th century with the lines between commercial and political dominance being increasingly blurred a number of European trading companies including the English East India Company had established coastal outposts135136 The East India Companys control of the seas greater resources and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies137135138139 Its further access to the riches of Bengal and the subsequent increased strength and size of its army enabled it to annex or subdue most of India by the 1820s140 India was then no longer exporting manufactured goods as it long had but was instead supplying the British Empire with raw materials Many historians consider this to be the onset of Indias colonial period135 By this time with its economic power severely curtailed by the British parliament and having effectively been made an arm of British administration the East India Company began more consciously to enter noneconomic arenas including education social reform and culture141', 'Historians consider Indias modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885 The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes essential to a modern state These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty the surveillance of the population and the education of citizens Technological changesamong them railways canals and the telegraphwere introduced not long after their introduction in Europe142143144145 However disaffection with the company also grew during this time and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857 Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions including invasive Britishstyle social reforms harsh land taxes and summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations of Company rule146147 Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858 it led to the dissolution of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited Britishstyle parliamentary system the new rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future unrest148149 In the decades following public life gradually emerged all over India leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885150151152153', 'The rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks and many small farmers became dependent on the whims of faraway markets154 There was an increase in the number of largescale famines155 and despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers little industrial employment was generated for Indians156 There were also salutary effects commercial cropping especially in the newly canalled Punjab led to increased food production for internal consumption157 The railway network provided critical famine relief158 notably reduced the cost of moving goods158 and helped nascent Indianowned industry157', 'After World War I in which approximately one million Indians served159 a new period began It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislation by more strident Indian calls for selfrule and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of noncooperation of which Mahatma Gandhi would become the leader and enduring symbol160 During the 1930s slow legislative reform was enacted by the British the Indian National Congress won victories in the resulting elections161 The next decade was beset with crises Indian participation in World War II the Congresss final push for noncooperation and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism All were capped by the advent of independence in 1947 but tempered by the partition of India into two states India and Pakistan162', 'Vital to Indias selfimage as an independent nation was its constitution completed in 1950 which put in place a secular and democratic republic163 Per the London Declaration India retained its membership of the Commonwealth becoming the first republic within it164 Economic liberalisation which began in the 1980s and the collaboration with Soviet Union for technical knowhow165 has created a large urban middle class transformed India into one of the worlds fastestgrowing economies166 and increased its geopolitical clout Yet India is also shaped by seemingly unyielding poverty both rural and urban167 by religious and casterelated violence168 by Maoistinspired Naxalite insurgencies169 and by separatism in Jammu and Kashmir and in Northeast India170 It has unresolved territorial disputes with China171 and with Pakistan171 Indias sustained democratic freedoms are unique among the worlds newer nations however in spite of its recent economic successes freedom from want for its disadvantaged population remains a goal yet to be achieved172', 'India accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent lying atop the Indian tectonic plate a part of the IndoAustralian Plate173 Indias defining geological processes began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana began a northeastward drift caused by seafloor spreading to its southwest and later south and southeast173 Simultaneously the vast Tethyan oceanic crust to its northeast began to subduct under the Eurasian Plate173 These dual processes driven by convection in the Earths mantle both created the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to underthrust Eurasia and to uplift the Himalayas173 Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas plate movement created a vast crescentshaped trough that rapidly filled with riverborne sediment174 and now constitutes the IndoGangetic Plain175 The original Indian plate makes its first appearance above the sediment in the ancient Aravalli range which extends from the Delhi Ridge in a southwesterly direction To the west lies the Thar Desert the eastern spread of which is checked by the Aravallis176177178', 'The remaining Indian Plate survives as peninsular India the oldest and geologically most stable part of India It extends as far north as the Satpura and Vindhya ranges in central India These parallel chains run from the Arabian Sea coast in Gujarat in the west to the coalrich Chota Nagpur Plateau in Jharkhand in the east180 To the south the remaining peninsular landmass the Deccan Plateau is flanked on the west and east by coastal ranges known as the Western and Eastern Ghats181 the plateau contains the countrys oldest rock formations some over one billion years old Constituted in such fashion India lies to the north of the equator between 6 44 and 35 30 north latitudem and 68 7 and 97 25 east longitude182', 'Indias coastline measures 7517 kilometres 4700 mi in length of this distance 5423 kilometres 3400 mi belong to peninsular India and 2094 kilometres 1300 mi to the Andaman Nicobar and Lakshadweep island chains183 According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts the mainland coastline consists of the following 43 sandy beaches 11 rocky shores including cliffs and 46 mudflats or marshy shores183', 'Major Himalayanorigin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal184 Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi the latters extremely low gradient caused by longterm silt deposition leads to severe floods and course changes185186 Major peninsular rivers whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding include the Godavari the Mahanadi the Kaveri and the Krishna which also drain into the Bay of Bengal187 and the Narmada and the Tapti which drain into the Arabian Sea188 Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India the latter is shared with Bangladesh189 India has two archipelagos the Lakshadweep coral atolls off Indias southwestern coast and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea190', 'Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons191 The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes192193 The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moistureladen southwest summer monsoon winds that between June and October provide the majority of Indias rainfall191 Four major climatic groupings predominate in India tropical wet tropical dry subtropical humid and montane194', 'Temperatures in India have risen by 07 C 13 F between 1901 and 2018195 Climate change in India is often thought to be the cause The retreat of Himalayan glaciers has adversely affected the flow rate of the major Himalayan rivers including the Ganges and the Brahmaputra196 According to some current projections the number and severity of droughts in India will have markedly increased by the end of the present century197', 'India is a megadiverse country a term employed for 17 countries which display high biological diversity and contain many species exclusively indigenous or endemic to them198 India is a habitat for 86 of all mammal species 137 of bird species 79 of reptile species 6 of amphibian species 122 of fish species and 60 of all flowering plant species199200 Fully a third of Indian plant species are endemic201 India also contains four of the worlds 34 biodiversity hotspots70 or regions that display significant habitat loss in the presence of high endemismn202', 'According to official statistics Indias forest cover is 713789 km2 275595 sq mi which is 2171 of the countrys total land area71 It can be subdivided further into broad categories of canopy density or the proportion of the area of a forest covered by its tree canopy203 Very dense forest whose canopy density is greater than 70 occupies 302 of Indias land area203204 It predominates in the tropical moist forest of the Andaman Islands the Western Ghats and Northeast India Moderately dense forest whose canopy density is between 40 and 70 occupies 939 of Indias land area203204 It predominates in the temperate coniferous forest of the Himalayas the moist deciduous sal forest of eastern India and the dry deciduous teak forest of central and southern India205 Open forest whose canopy density is between 10 and 40 occupies 926 of Indias land area203204 India has two natural zones of thorn forest one in the Deccan Plateau immediately east of the Western Ghats and the other in the western part of the IndoGangetic plain now turned into rich agricultural land by irrigation its features no longer visible206', 'Among the Indian subcontinents notable indigenous trees are the astringent Azadirachta indica or neem which is widely used in rural Indian herbal medicine207 and the luxuriant Ficus religiosa or peepul208 which is displayed on the ancient seals of Mohenjodaro209 and under which the Buddha is recorded in the Pali canon to have sought enlightenment210', 'Many Indian species have descended from those of Gondwana the southern supercontinent from which India separated more than 100 million years ago211 Indias subsequent collision with Eurasia set off a mass exchange of species However volcanism and climatic changes later caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms212 Still later mammals entered India from Asia through two zoogeographical passes flanking the Himalayas213 This had the effect of lowering endemism among Indias mammals which stands at 126 contrasting with 458 among reptiles and 558 among amphibians200 Among endemics are the vulnerable214 hooded leaf monkey215 and the threatened216 Beddomes toad216217 of the Western Ghats', 'India contains 172 IUCNdesignated threatened animal species or 29 of endangered forms218 These include the endangered Bengal tiger and the Ganges river dolphin Critically endangered species include the gharial a crocodilian the great Indian bustard and the Indian whiterumped vulture which has become nearly extinct by having ingested the carrion of diclofenactreated cattle219 Before they were extensively used for agriculture and cleared for human settlement the thorn forests of Punjab were mingled at intervals with open grasslands that were grazed by large herds of blackbuck preyed on by the Asiatic cheetah the blackbuck no longer extant in Punjab is now severely endangered in India and the cheetah is extinct220 The pervasive and ecologically devastating human encroachment of recent decades has critically endangered Indian wildlife In response the system of national parks and protected areas first established in 1935 was expanded substantially In 1972 India enacted the Wildlife Protection Act221 and Project Tiger to safeguard crucial wilderness the Forest Conservation Act was enacted in 1980 and amendments added in 1988222 India hosts more than five hundred wildlife sanctuaries and eighteen biosphere reserves223 four of which are part of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves seventyfive wetlands are registered under the Ramsar Convention224', 'A parliamentary republic with a multiparty system227 India has six recognised national parties including the Indian National Congress INC and the Bharatiya Janata Party BJP and more than 50 regional parties228 The Congress is considered centre in Indian political culture229 and the BJP rightwing230231232 For most of the period between 1950when India first became a republicand the late 1980s the Congress held a majority in the Parliament Since then however it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP233 as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of multiparty coalition governments at the centre234 India was 2023 the 19th most electoral democratic country in Asia according to the VDem Democracy indices 235', 'In the Republic of Indias first three general elections in 1951 1957 and 1962 the Pandit Jawaharlal Nehruled Congress won easy victories On Nehrus death in 1964 Lal Bahadur Shastri briefly became prime minister he was succeeded after his own unexpected death in 1966 by Nehrus daughter Indira Gandhi who went on to lead the Congress to election victories in 1967 and 1971 Following public discontent with the state of emergency she declared in 1975 the Congress was voted out of power in 1977 the thennew Janata Party which had opposed the emergency was voted in Its government lasted just over two years There were two prime ministers during this period Morarji Desai and Charan Singh Voted back into power in 1980 the Congress saw a change in leadership in 1984 when Indira Gandhi was assassinated she was succeeded by her son Rajiv Gandhi who won an easy victory in the general elections later that year The Congress was voted out again in 1989 when a National Front coalition led by the newly formed Janata Dal in alliance with the Left Front won the elections that government too proved relatively shortlived lasting just under two years There were two prime ministers during this period VP Singh and Chandra Shekhar236 Elections were held again in 1991 no party won an absolute majority The Congress as the largest single party was able to form a minority government led by P V Narasimha Rao237', 'A twoyear period of political turmoil followed the general election of 1996 Several shortlived alliances shared power at the centre The BJP formed a government briefly in 1996 it was followed by two comparatively longlasting United Front coalitions which depended on external support There were two prime ministers during this period HD Deve Gowda and IK Gujral In 1998 the BJP was able to form a successful coalition the National Democratic Alliance NDA Led by Atal Bihari Vajpayee the NDA became the first nonCongress coalition government to complete a fiveyear term238 Again in the 2004 Indian general elections no party won an absolute majority but the Congress emerged as the largest single party forming another successful coalition the

texts are called Vedas composed in Sanskrit Vedic Sanskrit is recorded only in hymns that were part of Vedic rituals to Aryan gods To be Aryan apparently meant to belong to the elite among pastoral

the collapse of the Indus valley civilization is no longer believed to have been due to an Aryan invasion it is widely thought that at roughly the same time or perhaps a few centuries later new IndoAryanspeaking people and influences began to enter the subcontinent from the northwest Detailed evidence is lacking Nevertheless a predecessor of the language that would eventually be called Sanskrit was probably introduced into the northwest sometime between 3900 and 3000 years ago This language was related to one then spoken in eastern Iran and both of these languages belonged to the IndoEuropean language family It seems likely that various smallscale migrations were involved in the gradual introduction of the predecessor language and associated cultural characteristics However there may not have been a tight relationship between movements of people on the one hand and changes in language and culture on the other Moreover the process whereby a dynamic new force gradually

magnitude of refugee movements in South Asia after 1947 must be understood in the context of preexisting migratory flows within the partitioned regions see also Chatterji 2013 She also demonstrates that the new national states of India and Pakistan were quickly drawn into trying to stem this migration As they put into place laws designed to restrict the return of partition emigrants this produced new dilemmas for both new nations in their treatment of overseas Indians and many of them lost their right to return to their places of origin in the subcontinent and also their claims to
